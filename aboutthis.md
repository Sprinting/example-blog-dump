description: a small explanation about this site

Hi, I'm Kartik Mudgal. 

I'm a software developer and tech enthusiast. This blog is a demo of simple-blog-gen, which is a simple static site generator that reads content from a github repo. 

[source-code](github.com/sprinting/simple-blog-gen) may be found here. comes with support for tagging, sorting, and grouping posts and a simple theme selector. 

If I feel like it, I may someday make it a fully featured static site generator, but these are the vehicles I use to learn new tech, so it is unlikely. 

you may find me at [kartikmudgal.com](kartikmudgal.com)
