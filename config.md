# AboutMe
Hi, I'm Kartik Mudgal. I'm a software developer and tech enthusiast. 
This blog is a demo of simple-blog-gen, which is a simple site generator 
that reads content from a github repo. [source-code](https://github.com/sprinting/simple-blog-gen) may be found here.

comes with support for tagging, sorting, and grouping posts
and a simple theme selector. If I feel like it, I may someday make it a fully featured site generator, 
but these are the vehicles I use to learn new tech, so it is unlikely.
